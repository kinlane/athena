<p>The presentations of evidence in the Oracle v.Google copyright case wrapped up on Friday, and only a few hours of closing arguments now stand between the jury and their deliberations.The beginning of the week was dominated by Googles defense case, with more star witnesses, including two former CEOs of Sun Microsystems: Eric Schmidt, who later became CEO of Google, and Jonathan Schwartz.Schwartz testified that he never considered suing Google over Android, because we didnt feel we had any grounds.On Friday, Oracles president and CFO, Safra Catz, testified today about how she and her colleagues at Oracle approached and tried to get the company to pay for a license to Java.</p>
