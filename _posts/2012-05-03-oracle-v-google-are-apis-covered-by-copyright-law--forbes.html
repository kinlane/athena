<p>The high stakes lawsuit between Oracle and Google is based on claims that Google’s Android infringes Oracle’s copyrights and patents related to Java.This article will attempt to explain the first phase of the trial relating to the copyright claims.The patent claims will be dealt with in a subsequent and separate phase of the case.  And the final phase of the trial will address Oracle’s damages, if any.Java is a programming platform originally developed by Sun in the 1990s and acquired by Oracle as part of its purchase of Sun in 2010.</p>
