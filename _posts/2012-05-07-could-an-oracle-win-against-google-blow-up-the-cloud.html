<p>A San Francisco court has spent the past few weeks considering a copyright question that could weigh heavy on the future of cloud computing.It’s part of a high-profile lawsuit between Oracle and Google.Oracle says that Google violated its copyrights and patents when it wrote its own version of Java for the Android mobile operating system.Part of what the court is trying to figure out this week is whether Google wronged Oracle by writing software that mimicked the Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs are coding standards that let programs communicate with one another).The conventional wisdom in the coder community has been that it’s fine to reproduce the interface of someone else’s APIs, so long as you don’t actually copy their software.</p>
