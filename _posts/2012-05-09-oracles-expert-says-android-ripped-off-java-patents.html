<p>Google’s Android operating system infringes on two patents owned by Oracle, according to Stanford professor John Mitchell, an expert witness hired by Oracle in the ongoing court battle over Android and its use of the Java programming language.With its case, Oracle claims that Android steps on two Java-related patents — U.S.Patents 6,061,520 and RE38,104 — and, yes, Mitchell agrees.The Stanford academic took the stand on Wednesday during the patent phase of the trial that pits Oracle against Google, and he was paid by Oracle.</p>
