<p>Fresh off its failed attempt to prove that Google’s Android operating system infringed on its Java patents, Oracle has sued a small company called Lodsys, complaining that the Texas-based outfit has been harassing its customers with questionable claims of patent infringement.“Lodsys has repeatedly threatened numerous Oracle customers with assertion of the Patents-in-Suit against Oracle’s Web Commerce Products,” Oracle’s suit read (.pdf).“Lodsys is not entitled to any royalties from Oracle or any of its customers, nor does Oracle or any of its customers need a license to the Patents-in-Suit.”
 Lodsys has made a name for itself in recent years with its efforts to pressure independent iOS and Android application developers into paying licenses fees for use of four patents it owns.</p>
