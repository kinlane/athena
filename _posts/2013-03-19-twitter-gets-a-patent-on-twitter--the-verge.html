<p>Although Twitter famously has a pending patent on the familiar pull-to-refresh gesture, the company may have just acquired something more valuable: a patent on the Twitter messaging service itself.The new patent issued today with Twitter founders Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone listed as inventors, and broadly describes a messaging service in which users follow each other and sent messages dont have specific recipients, but are rather sent and displayed to those followers by the system itself.Thats exactly how Twitter works, of course — its definitely more of a broadcasting system than a direct messaging service, and the patent claims explicitly make reference to broadcasting an update message several times.Twitter filed for the patent in 2007, but its doubtful the company will pursue any litigation against competing services with it now that its in hand — the company has very publicly promised to only use patents defensively, and last year introduced the Innovators Patent Agreement to codify that promise and require permission from its employees before suing offensively.But competing companies like Facebook will have to evaluate their products carefully against Twitters very broad claims on virtually any service that allows messages to be sent to a large group of unaddressed recipients who follow the sender.</p>
