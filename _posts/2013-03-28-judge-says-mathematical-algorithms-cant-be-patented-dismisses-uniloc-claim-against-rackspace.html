<p>A federal judge has thrown out a patent claim against Rackspace, ruling that mathematical algorithms can’t be patented. The ruling in the Eastern Disrict stemmed from a 2012 complaint filed by Uniloc USA asserting that processing of floating point numbers by the Linux operating system was a patent violation.Chief Judge Leonard Davis based the ruling on U.S.Supreme Court case law that prohibits the patenting of mathematical algorithms.</p>
