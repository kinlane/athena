<p>No, I am not blogging about India Pale Ale, although I must say that I am a big fan of it.I am writing about one of the best patent hacks I have seen in the decade that I have been working to find relief from the ridiculous patent system in our country.Twitter came up with a concept last year called the Innovators Patent Agreement (IPA) and put a draft IPA up on GitHub.They have gotten a ton of feedback and have iterated and improved the concept since then.The basic idea of the IPA is that it is a contract between Twitter and the engineer(s) and designer(s) who developed the IP.</p>
