<p>WASHINGTON — President Obama issued five executive orders on Tuesday to tighten regulations at the Patent and Trademark Office and make the process of patent disclosure more transparent, an effort to stem the array of legal attacks by holders of broad software patents on companies and consumers.The administration ordered the Patent Office to begin writing rules requiring patent applicants and owners to make clear who owns the companies – which are often little more than legal shells – that file for patents or that assert patent-infringement claims.The administration also instructed the Patent Office to tighten scrutiny of overly broad patent claims and said it would aim to curb patent-infringement lawsuits against consumers and small business owners who are simply using off-the-shelf technology.In 2011, Congress passed and the president signed legislation updating the patent system, but it quickly became clear that the effort failed to address what has become the country’s leading patent problem: legal battles initiated by patent-assertion entities, also known as patent trolls, that have no material business other than filing patent infringement claims.“What we need to do is to pull together additional stakeholders and see if we can build some additional consensus on smarter patent laws,” Mr.</p>
