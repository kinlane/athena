	"summary": "",
	"abstract": "The present embodiment is able to find the optimal or near optimal variables composition of multivariate models by an evolutionary process within acceptable amount of time and resources that are less than using full variables permutation methodology. Subjected to any data, it adaptively identifies and constructs the most effective combination of the relevant variables to achieve one or more objectives. The objective could be for high explanatory power, high predictive power, response measure, or other objectives that the user defines. The present embodiment solves the sequential F-test problem by conducting non-sequential and non-linear search. The algorithm also solves partial F-test dilemma by evaluating all candidate variables membership intact, maintaining fidelity of full variables membership test throughout its permutation. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of the algorithm neutralizes the prejudices of manual decisions in variables identification and membership construction.",

Random fluctuations in the load applied by multiple applications on multiple storage units are balanced nearly equally over all of the storage units. This combination of techniques results in a system which can transfer multiple, independent high-bandwidth streams of data in a scalable manner in both directions between multiple applications and multiple storage units.",

More specifically, a graphical user interface is described that simplifies the task of defining what types of components (hardware and software), domains and methods are to be used during an IT infrastructure discovery operation. One benefit of using the described user interface is that the user is relieved of the burden of determining what aspects of the discovery action need be defined. Another benefit is that a user may be asked for input for only those elements necessary to the discoveryu2014based on the user's prior input. For example, if the only type of component identified for discovery are JAVAu00ae platforms, only those discovery methods (e.g., JMX) related to JAVAu00ae platforms will be proffered to the user during that phase of specifying the discovery operation.",

	"abstract": "For ray tracing scenes composed of primitives, systems and methods accelerate intersection testing by testing rays against elements of geometry acceleration data (GAD) arranged in a graph of nodes, where pairs of nodes are connected by edges, and each element bounds a varying granularity selection of the primitives. Upon detection of intersections between rays and elements, references to the rays are added to respective collections associated with the elements. Further processing of those rays is deferred until rays of a given collection are determined ready, and then rays from such a ready collection are tested for intersection with elements of GAD connected by edges to the element associated with the ready collection. When a primitive is bounded by no higher granularity GAD element, it is tested for intersection, and indications of intersection are output. Some examples encourage production of many secondary rays and collect such rays for parallelized testing, regardless of traversal order, camera ray association, or a time when each ray was spawned.",

In one embodiment, the remote access architecture of the present provides a method for establishing a direct connection between peer computing devices via a third computing device, such as a gateway. Additionally, the present invention provides the following techniques to optimize peer-to-peer communications: 1) false acknowledgement of receipt of network packets allowing communications via a lossless protocol of packets constructed for transmission via a lossy protocol, 2) payload shifting of network packets allowing communications via a lossless protocol of packets constructed for transmission via a lossy protocol, 3) reduction of packet fragmentation by adjusting the maximum transmission unit (MTU) parameter, accounting for overhead due to encryption, 4) application-aware prioritization of client-side network communications, and 5) network disruption shielding for reliable and persistent network connectivity and access.",

Using the asset list identifier, the original asset list is found and retrieved from its safe location. The asset identifiers from the retrieved asset list are used to find and retrieve the individual assets from their backup locations. The assets are verified by recomputing the cryptographic hash asset identifier for each asset retrieved and comparing it to the asset identifier from the asset list. The MD5 algorithm is used for the cryptographic hash function. Assets are retrieved using a multicast protocol.

	"abstract": "Property value estimation employs a comparable sales technique that calculates a feature distance between a target property and corresponding comparable properties. Determining estimated values for properties includes performing a regression based upon property features for properties in a relatively large geographical area. A set of comparable properties from a section of the relatively large geographical area is identified, and a feature distance between each property from the set of comparable properties and a target property is calculated using information from the regression. The feature distance provides a quantified indication of the difference between each property from the set of comparable properties and the target property for the plurality of property features. An estimated value for the target property is then determined based upon a value of each of the comparable properties and adjustments based upon the calculated feature distances.",

In particular, as a client moves from a subnet associated with a first network element to a subnet associated with a second network element, a determination is made regarding whether the client is roaming. This is done by evaluating a source IP address within a L3 packet header within a first frame received at the second network element. If, as a result of the evaluating step, it is determined that the client is roaming, an L2 bridge forwarding table in the second network element is configured to include a source MAC address of the client together with information identifying at least a destination interface for use in directing client data traffic back towards the subnet associated with the first network element. The first frame is then forwarded. In one embodiment, the traffic is directed back towards the subnet associated with the first network element via a GRE encapsulation tunnel, although any convenient tunneling mechanism can be used. According to another feature, given information cached at the foreign access point is used to enable the roaming client to continue to seamlessly receive inbound traffic prior to or during the configuration of the L2 bridge forwarding table (i.e., before any outbound traffic is actually sent from the client).",

The threading rules thread outgoing messages sent in response to an incoming message from a user, or incoming messages where a previous outgoing message was sent to the user. An SMS application displays threads in a user interface and indicates messages threads with an icon in one view, and displays an expanded message thread in another view.",

The local node has a memory management unit (MMU), which provides an effective address to real address (EA-to-RA) translation table that is utilized by the HFI to evaluate when EAs of GSM operations/data from a received GSM packet is memory-mapped to RAs of the local memory. The HFI retrieves the EA associated with a GSM operation/data within a received GSM packet. The HFI forwards the EA to the MMU, which determines when the EA is mapped to RAs within the local memory for the local task. The HFI processing logic enables processing of the GSM packet only when the EA of the GSM operation/data within the GSM packet is an EA that has a local RA translation. Non-matching EAs result in an error condition that requires debugging.",

As consumers initiate receive operations, receive work queue entries (RWQEs) are created by the ULP and written to the receive work queue (RWQ). The ISPOE is notified of a new entry to the RWQ and it subsequently reads this entry that contains pointers to the data that is to be received. After the data is received, the IPSOE creates a completion queue entry (CQE) that is written into the completion queue (CQ). After the CQE is written, the ULP subsequently processes the entry and removes it from the CQE, freeing up a space in both the RWQ and CQ. The number of entries available in the RWQ are monitored by the ULP so that it does not overwrite any valid entries.

A determination as to which implementation of a virtual overridden method to inline is made based on its relative u201chotnessu201d compared to the other implementations of the same method. The relative hotness can be inferred from the invocation count and sampling count that the virtual machine and the just-in-time compiler already collect for other purposes, that is, without collecting and storing of call-edge profiling information. When a method is being compiled and it is identified that the method contains a call to an overridden method, a candidate for inlining from among the implementations of the overridden method is selected based on relative hotness values. The candidate implementation of the overridden method is then inlined, with a guard, into the calling method.",

With client-to-AP mapping, these techniques are used to prevent the discovery of multiple APs in a WLAN by a client device and to select a single AP (using certain policies) to associate with the client device and provide it with an enhanced wireless connection to the WLAN. Additionally, techniques are employed to centrally determine, using central policies, when the AP should disassociate from the client device and when another centrally selected AP should respond to, and associate with, the client device to provide it with an enhanced wireless connection to the WLANu2014without interrupting/disrupting the client device's access.",

For several embodiments of the present invention, one method for optimizing synchronization is to reduce the overhead required for said synchronization by having each peer only tracking changes for itself and other peers within its change community (or communities) (a.k.a., u201cIntra-Community-Only Change Tracking Optimizationu201d). For certain embodiments of the present invention, another method for optimizing synchronization is to not create synchronization overhead until required. For numerous embodiments of the present invention, yet another method for optimizing synchronization is to minimize redundant use of a partner's unique global IDu2014a large and cumbersome numberu2014and to instead maintain a table that cross-references each partner (and its unique global ID) with a smaller and much less cumbersome partner key.",

Synchronization operations are scheduled according to a synchronization schedule that is based on a current time of day. In one embodiment, the day can be divided into different time periods by the user. The user can also specify the frequency with which synchronization operations are to be performed during each specified period. Further, the user can specify an override schedule which overrides the ordinary synchronization schedule established by the user when override criteria are present. For instance, if the mobile device is roaming, the synchronization schedule will be dictated by the override schedule, which may sync much less often, or not until a specific user synchronization request has been received. The present invention can be embodied both as a method and as a apparatus. Also, the user interface associated with the present invention provides for user input to specify time periods during the day, synchronization frequency information, and an override schedule.",

The dashboard queue's contents (often large) are truncated as necessary to fit in the relatively smaller queue space. When transitioning from a game to the dashboard mode, copying the queue back takes place after the dashboard is operational.

This retention date scheme does not utilize any proprietary application program interfaces (APIs) or protocols, but rather, employs native functionality within conventional file (or other data containers, data sets or block-based logical unit numbers) properties available in commonly used operating systems. In an illustrative embodiment, the retention date/time is calculated by querying the file's last-modified time prior to commit, adding the retention period to this value and thereby deriving a retention date after which the file can be released from WORM. Prior to commit, the computed retention date is stored in the file's u201clast access timeu201d property/attribute field, or another metadata field that remains permanently associated with the file and that, in being used for retention date, does not interfere with file management in a WORM state. Since this field is not utilized in a WORM context, it can be adapted to store this date. Once stored, the retention date in this field is locked against modification. Where extension (never reduction) of a retention period is desired, the last access time field be updated, wherein the new retention period is added to the existing last access time value to derive a new, later retention date for the file.

In some exploitations, our techniques provide a way to manage dynamically allocated memory in a non-blocking manner without depending on garbage collection.

According to one aspect, in order to subject a test database system to the same workload to which the production database system actually would be subjected, a database server in the production system captures and records workload that the database server receives from external entities. This captured workload is processed. Processes external to a database server in the test database system send the processed workload to that database server. As a result, the test database system is subjected to the same workload to which the production database system originally was subjected. The foregoing technique permits a database administrator to determine how the production database system will fare if the difference that is present in the test database system is introduced into the production database system.",

According to one aspect, in order to subject a test database system to the same workload to which the production database system actually would be subjected, a database server in the production system captures and records workload that the database server receives from external entities. This captured workload is processed. Processes external to a database server in the test database system send the processed workload to that database server. As a result, the test database system is subjected to the same workload to which the production database system originally was subjected. The foregoing technique permits a database administrator to determine how the production database system will fare if the difference that is present in the test database system is introduced into the production database system.",

Such a system may operate in conjunction with legacy station controllers, or the station controller can be eliminated and replaced by multiple modules that distribute the many types of functions typically incorporated into conventional station controllers.",

If overlap is detected, the mobile device demodulates both the paging channel carried by the Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (S-CCPCH) and the broadcast channel carried by the Primary CCPCH, avoiding a mobile-terminated (MT) call setup delay by waiting for the next SIB7 broadcast, which depending upon a SIB7 repetition ranges from 360 msec to 2.56 seconds.",

The implementation of one or more Web Service specifications may be packaged into one common module so that the complexity of the Web Services is hidden from developers. New services may be added to the MFP and existing services may be updated through communication with the DFM.",

In several embodiments of the invention, when the user couples the phone to a network, a computer associated with the network automatically checks to see if the phone was previously provisioned. If not previously provisioned, the computer automatically records the existence of the phone in a memory of a telephone exchange that is to thereafter provide service to the phone. At this stage a phone number is not yet associated with the phone. In some embodiments, the just-described acts, namely checking and recording of existence are performed without any involvement on part of the administrator. The telephone exchange provides basic service to the new phone as soon as it detects existence of the phone (in its memory). Thereafter, in certain embodiments, the user uses that particular phone to identify himself/herself (and/or an extension number) and in response the computer stores the extension number in the telephone exchange's memory, thereby to enable the phone to receive calls at that extension number. Such automatic provisioning eliminates the need for an administrator to provision the phone.",

Studies have shown that certain frequency ranges are particularly important for human ears' location-discriminating capability, while other ranges are generally ignored. Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are examples response functions that characterize how ears perceive sound positioned at different locations. By selecting one or more u201clocation-criticalu201d portions of such response functions, one can construct simple filters that can be used to simulate heating where location-discriminating capability is substantially maintained.

Tasks can be defined on a technical computing client, and the tasks organized into jobs. The technical computing client can directly distribute tasks to one or more technical computing workers. Furthermore, the technical computing client can submit tasks, or jobs comprising tasks, to an automatic task distribution mechanism that distributes the tasks automatically to one or more technical computing workers providing technical computing services. The technical computing worker performs technical computing of tasks and the results of the execution of tasks may be provided to the technical computing client. Data associated with the tasks is managed by a programmable interface associated with a data storage repository. The interface allows the various entities of the distributed technical computing environment to access data services performable by the interface or by a file system or a database and database management system associated with the data.",

We have implemented a working prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6u2014from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 u03bcs with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access to potentially u201cunlimitedu201d network memory resources.",

Clients can choose which storage nodes to store data on based on dynamic measures of node performance. Since there is no coupling among storage servers, performance can scale horizontally by adding more nodes. The decoupling also allows the front end services and storage to scale independently. High service availability is achieved by object-level synchronous replication and having no single point of failure. Failed nodes are rebuilt using copies of data in other nodes without taking the cluster offline. In addition to the replication, the ability to add or remove nodes on-line reduces maintenance-related service downtime.",
