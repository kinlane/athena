Compensation information based on the displacement is determined, and a reshaped image is rendered from the mesh, the compensation information, and the camera image. The camera image is reshaped by relocating a proper subset of the points on the camera image. Deformation vectors are applied to corresponding points on the mesh using the compensation information. A correction factor is obtained from an angular displacement and a translation displacement of the source image from the camera image. The deformation factor is multiplied by the compensation factor to form a deformation vector to compensate for angular and translational displacements of the source image from the camera image.",

A combination of access and flow control can be used, wherein a control gateway or other such component sits along a path between the user and the resource, such that the user obtains connections or access to the resource through the gateway. In this way, the gateway can control aspects such as the number of concurrent threads or channels granted to a user, as well as any delay in providing these threads or channels to the resource. A closed feedback loop can provide real-time information such that adjustments can be made dynamically, preventing abuse by users while also preventing the resource allocations from being underutilized.",

	"summary": "",
	"abstract": "It is desirable to provide a bitstream format for compressed data that would allow multiple processors to access and decompress different parts of the data in parallel. Compressed images are usually defined in terms of macroblocks that have a width less than the image width and a height less than the image height. Thus, an image is divided several bands of multiple lines, and each band of multiple lines is divided into a macroblock. The set of macroblocks that define a band is called herein a macroblock rasterscan. The bit stream format includes, for each image, a picture header followed by image scan data. The image scan data includes data corresponding to a plurality of macroblock rasterscans. The data for each macroblock rasterscan includes data for a plurality of macroblocks for a band of lines in the image followed by padding. The padding ensures that data for each macroblock rasterscan terminates on a data boundary. The picture header references an image scan index that indicates a number of macroblock rasterscans in the image scan data and a number of lines per macroblock rasterscan, followed by entries of the index. Each entry in the index includes an offset of the macroblock rasterscan in image scan. The picture header may contain a reference to a picture header type, that references an I_frame_image_descriptor, which references the image scan index.",

The data is divided into segments and each segment is distributed randomly on one of several storage units, independent of the storage units on which other segments of the media data are stored. At least one additional copy of each segment also is distributed randomly over the storage units, such that each segment is stored on at least two storage units. This random distribution of multiple copies of segments of data improves both scalability and reliability. When an application requests a selected segment of data, the request is processed by the storage unit with the shortest queue of requests. Random fluctuations in the load applied by multiple applications on multiple storage units are balanced nearly equally over all of the storage units. This combination of techniques results in a system which can transfer multiple, independent high-bandwidth streams of data in a scalable manner in both directions between multiple applications and multiple storage units.",

	"abstract": "The present solution provides a variety of techniques for accelerating and optimizing network traffic, such as HTTP based network traffic. The solution described herein provides techniques in the areas of proxy caching, protocol acceleration, domain name resolution acceleration as well as compression improvements. In some cases, the present solution provides various prefetching and/or prefreshening techniques to improve intermediary or proxy caching, such as HTTP proxy caching. In other cases, the present solution provides techniques for accelerating a protocol by improving the efficiency of obtaining and servicing data from an originating server to server to clients. In another cases, the present solution accelerates domain name resolution more quickly. As every HTTP access starts with a URL that includes a hostname that must be resolved via domain name resolution into an IP address, the present solution helps accelerate HTTP access. In some cases, the present solution improves compression techniques by prefetching non-cacheable and cacheable content to use for compressing network traffic, such as HTTP. The acceleration and optimization techniques described herein may be deployed on the client as a client agent or as part of a browser, as well as on any type and form of intermediary device, such as an appliance, proxying device or any type of interception caching and/or proxying device.",

Increased packet processing speed can be achieved in several ways. For example, the firewall and IDS can process packets in series, in parallel, and sometimes singularly when one of the components is not permitted to process a packet. Alternatively, singular processing can also be performed when one component is permitted to pass a packet to the secured computer network without checking with the other component.",

	"summary": "",
	"abstract": "A server architecture performs concurrent information processing in a server system on a multi-core processor environment. The architecture supports simultaneous processing requests comprising multiple classes of queries and/or executing transactions in an application server and/or database server. Requests, which are made in an asynchronous manner, are structured with hash values to enable similar requests to be grouped together. The similar requests are grouped into a group session. All of the requests in the group session are executed at the same time. Accordingly, similar database inserts can be grouped and executed as a single request. The architecture minimizes thread-switching overhead by exploiting inherent parallelism in the inflowing requests. The threads and requests are de-coupled and hence any lock request only makes the execution threads take up another request instead of waiting until the lock is acquired. As such, the threads never go into sleep/wait mode and system resources are utilized more efficiently.",

Metrics are computed for the different types of messages and interactions provided by applications. For each channel, an application receives user affinity score based on specific weighted combination of the metrics. Applications use channel resources to send messages to increase their user base. Given the large number of applications that are available, the extent to which applications are allowed to use channels is controlled, limiting their resource consumption.

An Optimal Execution applies the dynamic policy resulting in a manufacturing system that is robust enough to accommodate moderate changes in demand and/or capacity without the need to reschedule. Optimal Execution may also involve a u201cCapacity Triggeru201d that detects when the assumptions regarding demand and capacity used to determine the dynamic policy are no longer valid.

The system functions in a multithreaded environment and is capable of handling complex routing rules and message transformation. It is also capable of learning and executing new routing rules and message transformations in formats previously unrecognized by the system. The system enables precise and reliable logging of messages throughout processing and supports publication of enterprise-wide broadcast messages. The system further preferably employs cooperating inbound and outbound transport processes for consuming, routing, processing, safely storing and publishing messages in batches of logical units of work to ensure that the logical units of work are not lost in system transactions. The system also preferably utilizes a replay server for preserving and replaying messages that might otherwise fail to reach their intended destinations.",

A conversion engine is provided by the present invention for converting the intermediate representation of native functions to the just-in-time (JIT) compiler's intermediate representation. With the converted intermediate representation, an inliner recursively inlines the converted JIT compiler's intermediate representation into the native callsite to remove the need of invoking the native function and subsequent native calls made by the function. The inlining process continues until either a call to an opaque function is encountered or until a JIT compiler intermediate representation growth limits are reached. The inliner also replaces calls to most native functions that are non-inlineable or opaque with calls to synthesized native functions that provide access to native libraries containing implementations of the original non-inlineable calls.",

The processor executes the initialization function of the platform-specific module to initialize the device during the platform-dependent phase of the kernel boot sequence, and wherein the processor executes the platform-independent phase of the kernel boot sequence after executing the initialization function of the platform-specific module.",

For instance, a network management device sends configuration data to a managed network device in accordance with a device management protocol and calls, using a test packet parameter, a device configuration function exposed by a managed device. When the device configuration function is called, the managed device processes the test packet to produce a result in accordance with the configuration data as if the test packet had been received from the network, and the managed device returns a test packet processing result.",

The messaging infrastructure improves availability and scalability of a message application by improving on the availability and scalability of the underlying message transports. In particular, availability and scalability are improved by linking the message application at runtime with any number of the message transports, without the message application specifying a transport at development time. The message infrastructure receives instructions from the message application specifying end-to-end delivery assurances. The infrastructure uses transports in order to fulfill the specified delivery assurance, and creates a link between the message application and transports for use in exchanging messages. Session state storage can be maintained in a pluggable store, which could be, for example, a durable database store or an application memory store.",

These characteristics are then compared with the indicators of non-native usage, thereby detecting non-native usage. The evaluation of non-native usage may be used as a versatile foundation to enhance a wide variety of tools and applications dealing with user interaction in languages other than their native language.",

It may be difficult to perform operations on such values, particularly if a domain that generated a particular value cannot be identified or no longer exist, which may obstruct shared accessing of values and evaluative tasks such as stack walks. Instead, accessors may be associated with a stored value that perform various operations (such as low-level assembly instructions like Load, Store, and Compare) according to the standards of the value-generating domain, and domains may be configured to operate on the value through the accessors. This configuration may promote consistent accessing of values without having to identify or consult the value-generating domain or reconfiguring the instruction sets.",

Thus the system operates at the point where the RFID data stream leaves the RF interface and enters a physical transmission medium before any other active components on the network (such as databases, middleware, routers). The RFID security server analyzes RFID tag data (including meta-data) received from the reader in-band and detects malware and errors in the data. RFID tag data containing malware or errors is blocked from entering the enterprise back-end. In an embodiment, analyzing RFID tag data includes generating a security stamp that is uniquely associated with the tag data. The security stamp is stored on the RFID tag, or alternatively, stored separately for later comparison in order to detect tampering.",

An override monitor unit within the processor stores the programmed state for any setting that is overridden so that the programmed state can be restored when the error condition no longer exists. The override monitor unit overrides the programmed state by forcing the setting to a legal value that does not cause an error condition. The processor is able to continue operating without notifying a device driver that an error condition has occurred since the error condition is avoided.",

As each thread completes, the output of the thread is stored in on-chip GPU memory for processing by the next stage in the graphics pipeline.

The hosted system determines whether the message should be sent over a telephone line at the hosted system or the school district. Instructions are sent to a delivery mechanism at the determined location indicating how to prepare the message and the number to be called. In one embodiment, the instructions are in XML script form to reduce the bandwidth required. Having the hosted system determine the allocation of messages allows for both the efficient use and lower calling cost of any available capacity on telephone lines at a school district or other collective organization, as well as the larger capacity access to telephone lines of a hosted service for quick delivery of numerous or urgent messages.",

First and second scaling parameters P and Q are determined in accordance with the block numbers L and M and the scaling ratio L/M or M/L. A non-uniform, or uneven, sampling in the DCT domain is then applied to coefficients of successive blocks in the compressed image in accordance with the scaling parameters. In an embodiment, P blocks are sampled and transformed from a given block length to |P| according to a |P|-point IDCT, while Q blocks are sampled and transformed from a given block length to |Q| according to a |Q|-point IDCT. The non-uniformly sampled and transformed pixel domain samples are then regrouped into a predetermined block size and transformed back to generate the DCT coefficient of the compressed image. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational complexity compared with other DCT domain arbitrary ratio image resizing approach. It also facilitates the practical implementations since only the fast implementations of IDCT with length N (1<N<9) and DCT with length 8 are required.",

Some mobile devices can support simultaneous data and voice channels, with the PBX and application server respectively. Where a data channel is unavailable, a control and status updating mechanism is needed. One approach is to signal over the voice channel with DTMF tones. DTMF tones should be timed to cause the tones to arrive at the mobile device during a pause period of a ring cycle. However, it also is desirable to avoid unnaturally long silence periods or other pauses during system usage. Aspects relate to enhancing a user experience in these situations and successful transmission/reception of control and status information over a voice channel using DTMF tones.",

The network includes a transaction processing layer with at least one accounting component with a general ledger data base for centrally storing information contained in accounted-related data sets, a data warehousing layer and an additional data sourcing layer. A duplicator receives the data sets that will be or have been stored in the general ledger data base and delivers duplicates of those data sets that fulfil a predefined criteria in a procurement context. A source data base stores the duplicated data sets on a data line level. An extractor of the data sourcing layer interfaces with the data warehousing layer and selectively moves data contained in data lines or sets of data lines from the source data base to the data warehousing layer.",

The methods and systems use Boolean space algebra operations to manage allocation and deallocation of tiled virtual memory pages in a tiled virtual memory provided by a tiled virtual memory subsystem. A region quadtree may be maintained representing a current allocation state of tiled virtual memory pages within a container. The region quadtree may be used to locate a rectangle or two dimensional (2D) array of unallocated tiled virtual memory pages, and physical memory pages may be mapped to tiled virtual memory pages in the rectangle by updating a lookup table used to translate tiled virtual memory page addresses to physical memory page addresses. A union or intersection of region quadtrees may be performed to generate a new region quadtree representing a new current allocation state of the tiled virtual memory pages.",

The mobile terminal can u201cload-shareu201d traffic, i.e., it can distribute segments of traffic over a full set of heterogeneous networks, significantly improving the reliability and availability of communications. In a first embodiment, a mobile terminal is configured with multiple radio frequency (RF) transceivers. Operating system software is provided for dynamically establishing and maintaining traffic flow for user applications over multiple communications paths, and for automatically adapting to variations in the networking environment, application traffic flow requirements, end user preferences, or mobility. In a second embodiment, a software-defined radio is used to implement the physical layer protocols for each desired network, eliminating the need for multiple transceivers.",

In addition, the method includes assigning the call to the agent, in response to the call status determination determining that the person answered the call at the destination. Therefore, the agent is able to monitor the call and assume a natural response to the person, thus eliminating delay as the conversation begins.",

The multigraph is represented using bitmaps with element counters and mappings between values and organized bitmaps to faciliate the handling of the multigraphs.

Mappings allow, given a value, accessing the objects of the multigraph which contain such value. Multigraph operations are solved by accessing the mappings and applying logical operations on the bitmaps. This way of representing a graph allows efficiently performing graph operations such as: inserting a vertex or an edge, inserting an attribute, acquiring the incoming and outgoing edges of an attribute, etc.",

	"summary": "",
	"abstract": "The present patent application discloses a USB token that advantageously mimics a human interface device such as a keyboard in interacting with a host computer, thus removing the need for pre-installation of a dedicated device driver. This is accomplished by requiring the host computer to direct the input of the attached human interface devices of the keyboard type, including the USB token, exclusively to the program interacting with the USB token, by using cryptographic algorithms based on a shared secret, which require less data to be transferred than PKI-based algorithms, and by employing an efficient encoding scheme that minimizes the time needed to exchange information with the USB token, and minimizes the probability of generating ambiguity with input that might legitimately be generated by other attached human interface devices. By using only symmetric encryption and the low-speed USB protocol, a single low-performance processor may be used, which results in a more cost-effective solution than PKI USB tokens emulating the combination of smart cards and smart card readers or USB tokens presenting themselves to the host computer as mass storage devices. The overall security is increased by adding a second authentication factor consisting of a static password entered by the user, and by limiting the number of valid token response that can be generated or retrieved in a usage session.",

The server includes a smart card emulator that emulates a smart card by using the card data base and a hardware security module. The emulator interacts with a pseudo card reader module in the server that imitates a physical card reader. The server also includes a client code module that interacts with the pseudo card reader and a remote payment or load server. A pass-through client terminal presents a user interface and passes information between the OPAL server and a merchant server, and between the OPAL server and a bank server. The Internet provides the routing functionality between the client terminal and the various servers. A merchant advertises goods on a web site. A user uses the client terminal to purchase goods and/or services from the remote merchant server. The payment server processes, confirms and replies to the merchant server. The payment server is also used to authenticate the holder of a virtual card who wishes to redeem loyalty points from a merchant. To load value, the client terminal requests a load from a user account at the bank server. The load server processes, confirms and replies to the bank server.",
