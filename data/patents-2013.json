The headset enables a user to discover and interact with applications resident on the headset, gateway, or a network accessible by the gateway. The headset functions as an application platform for the control and execution of the applications. The invention includes a method for providing a service to a user of the headset. The method involves the headset performing service discovery on the audio gateway to determine a method of transferring an application to the audio gateway, where the application provides the service. The headset causes the application to be transferred to the audio gateway using a method based on the service discovery, and the audio gateway executes the application, enabling the user to issue voice commands that are executed by the audio gateway to provide the service.",

Context information for a current message includes reply messages, parent messages, and metadata representations. Message representations are also associated with visual depth indicators that are independent of the text of the messages. Users may navigate displays of hierarchical message data using different navigational inputs. For example, more information may be requested for messages, without selecting a new message for viewing as a focal message, using swipes across portions of the display dedicated to displaying the messages. A limited number of messages for a requested list of messages is initially retrieved and displayed, and a mechanism for viewing more messages from the list is provided. Historical usage of the mechanism is recorded and the number of messages to be displayed for the list of messages is adjusted based on the historical usage data.",

The digital signatures identify what authority signed the code, what the code contains, what type of program the code is, or other identifying information. When the signed code is later executed on a computer system, its identity is obtained by accessing encrypted information of the code stored on disk. The architecture then determines whether the identity satisfies at least one requirement imposed on the code for some purpose. If the code has been altered from when it was signed or it fails to satisfy a requirement imposed, the code will not have a valid identity. In addition to verifying the identity of the code, the architecture also validates executing code immediately responsible for managing the code and additional executing code in a chain of hosts responsible for managing one another.",

A multiplexer component collects input signal from the one or more LED strings via a first set of one or more monitoring pins, processes the collected input signal, and extracts at least one output signal. The at least one output signal is conveyed to a demultiplexer component through a second set of one or more monitoring pins, wherein the number of elements in the second set of monitoring pins is equal to or smaller than the number of monitoring pins in the first set. The collected input signal is processed in accordance with at least one mode of operation of the multiplexer component, the mode of operation autonomously configured by the demultiplexer component. The multiplexer component can autonomously generate intelligence on operating status of the set of LED strings.",

Such expectation information can be presented as a single bit determined by a shader performing a dot product of the ray and a normal of a primitive intersected by a parent ray, or can be obtained as a by-product of ray/primitive intersection testing.

	"abstract": "In general, techniques are described for utilizing anonymous cookies within computer networks to protect customer identities. In particular, a network device is configured to communicate with an edge router of a service provider network that provides access to a public network having network destinations. The network device includes a control unit and an interface. The control unit executes a content delivery layer and a privacy services layer. The content delivery layer receives a network communication sent from one of the customer devices to the public network. The privacy services layer replaces a destination-specified cookie within the network communication with an anonymous cookie, each of which conform to an application layer protocol. The anonymous cookie also specifies a pseudonym for the one of the customer devices that originated the network communication. The at least one interface then forwards the network communication including the anonymous cookie to the network destination.",

	"abstract": "Often, information regarding images and/or other data may be incomplete. For example, an image may have depth information associated with a portion of the image, but not the entire image. It may be advantageous to extrapolate the values from the known points to the entire image. Accordingly, a dimensional array representing an image (or other data) may be traversed one or more times to generate an interpolated table. The interpolated table may comprise pixels of unknown value, where a pixel of unknown value may be associated with a number of pixels with known values. In this way, values for pixels may be specified based upon values of pixels having known values.",

For instance, a device can interact with various endpoints of a direction-based location service and any of the content or other information exchanged between clients and services can be synchronized for efficient exchange of information and efficient utilization of network bandwidth and resources. For example, change input is received by a device that alters, deletes or augments dynamically updateable information associated with a point of interest and the changes resulting from the change input are synchronized from the mobile device to a location based network service. Optionally, the synchronization can be according to a knowledge exchange to identify what should be synchronized prior to transmitting the updates.",
