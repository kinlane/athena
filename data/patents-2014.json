Available players or players on other teams can be analyzed according to projected statistics, and the projected statistics can be compared to projected statistics of one or more players on the team. In addition, the projected statistics can be further narrowed based on a specified period of time, desired positions, and/or the like. Based on the comparison, trade or acquisition recommendations can be generated for the team. Other parameters can be utilized in making such recommendations, such as a waiver status of the team, a propensity of a team owner to accept trades, etc. In addition, statistics can be projected for players based on one or more received statistics projections.",

The leakage is prevented by a key derivation function (KDF), but standards do not agree on key derivation functions. The module for performing a DH private key operation must somehow support multiple different KDF standards. The present invention provides an intermediate approach that neither attempts to implement all possible KDF operations, nor provide unprotected access to the raw DH private key operation. Instead, the module performs parts of the KDF operation, as indicated by the application using the module. This saves the module from implementing the entire KDF for each KDF needed. Instead, the module implements only re-usable parts that are common to most KDFs. Furthermore, when new KDFs are required, the module may be able to support them if they built on the parts that the module has implemented.",

In this case a few controls (simulation start and stop signals from the CPU and the simulation completion signal back to CPU), GPU programs and input/output data are the information exchanged between CPU and the expansion card. Moreover, since on every time step of the simulation the results from the previous time step are used but not changed, the results are preferably transferred back to CPU in parallel with the computation.",

Uplink macro-diversity is achieved in part through intelligent selective forwarding over multiple communication connections, where the forwarding decision is controlled by the end node based on a variety of factors, e.g., physical-layer channel conditions and/or higher layer policy. The forwarding decision is executed on a rapid timescale, e.g., on a per packet basis, to adapt to the dynamically varying conditions of the set of communication connections.",

Among other advantages, real-world clinical environments may enjoy cost savings for initial system procurement, space savings on clinic floors, easier and less expensive system upgrades, and the ability to use a single system and user interface for both FFBU screening and for follow-up diagnosis, biopsy, etc. Among other advantages from an ultrasound manufacturer's perspective are the ability to quickly and/or more easily come to market with an FFBU-related offering by modifying their existing general-purpose ultrasound systems with FFBU toolkits to quickly create dual-capability ultrasound systems.",

The method initiates with selecting a new game feature for testing from the set of new game features. Users are assigned to a test group or control group. Each of the test group users is provided a gaming application including the selected new game feature enabled. Each of the control group users is provided the gaming application without the selected new game feature enabled. Evaluation scores are generated based on gaming activity and social network activity. A score comparison report is generated comparing the evaluations scores of the test group and the control group. Based on the score comparison report, it is determined whether to continue testing one or more additional new game features from the set of new game features.",

The software transmits the request to a second player of the MMO game who is associated with the first player through a relationship recognized by the MMO game.

The time period depends on one or more factors related to game mechanics and to user data for the first player. Then if the second player does not respond within the time period and the game task is a game task whose completion can be assigned without the assistance of another player, the software assigns completion of the game task to the first player and transmits an automated apparent response to the first player.",
